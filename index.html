    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Matt Juntima, and I am a sophomore studying Computer
      Science at <a href="https://cs.vt.edu/">Virginia Tech</a>. I am an avid
      learner and problem solver focused on the data science part of computer
      science but also open to other areas in the field. <br />
      My goal as a professional is to keep learning and improving my skills in
      computer science while maintaining a positive attitude in the workplace.
      <br />
      Some languages I am familiar with are Java, Python and C. I am also
      familiar with using Pandas, Jupyter, command line, SQL and MATLAB.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Experience</h2>

    <p>Computers have been around all my life and I have always been tinkering with them. I have always been interested in how a computer works and how it interacts
      with other devices. I was fortunate enought that my highschool had a computer science program and I learned about Java and object orientated programming. It led me 
      to apply as an engineering major pursing computer science at Virginia Tech. After taking CS classes in high school and college, 
      I knew I made the right decision. Computer science has endless topics such as cloud, data science, software engineering, etc. The oppertunities and topics you can learn 
      are endless.
      The projects were incredibly hard, but the hours of working through and solving problems was rewarding.
      In college I then increased my repitoire with python and C. </p>

    <p>I value in working smarter not harder as a key value in my life. This values make me competent in the workplace because it allows me to find the always 
        efficient as possible. I am always looking for the easiest solution. This helps me in my field because in efficiency is key in computer science and in C,
        memory management is good to know. Having a positive attitude is also a key value in my life. This helps form my interpersonal skills and to
        communicate with people in the workplace. I hope that I can depeen my knowledge in the computer science field, specificly the data science field of computer science.
    </p>
